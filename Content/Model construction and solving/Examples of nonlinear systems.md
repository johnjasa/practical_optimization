Truss solver, could make it for one particular truss
curve fitting / L2 norm minimization
Sellar (cyclic connections) (abstract and isn't physical)
Nonlinear circuit analysis (node voltage analysis with explicit and implicit components)

Need some good examples to use balance comp
Cyclic connections
2D airfoil on a spring (vectorized?)
Eigenvalue solve! (look at Graeme's example for singularity)

Need examples for debugging bad solver behavior
- out of order calcs create fake implicitness
- pycycle case - guessing and manual convergence (talk to [[Jennifer]])
- linesearch bounds issues
- check with Ben for some simple solver cases he might have made for a class

Normal shock equations, especially relevant for [[Implicit vs explicit]]

Note from [[Eric]]: focus on giving practical engineering problems
