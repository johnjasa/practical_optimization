## Main message
Please please please use Git often when building models and optimizations to keep track of your efforts and scripts, especially in a collaborative environment.

## What is Git?
- set to the tune of "what is hip" by tower of power
- Git is a form of source code control
- there are infinite resources out there to help you
- Git is different than Github
	- Github is a website that hosts Git repos
	- Git is a piece of software to help you control versioned files

## When to use Git?
- Honestly, if you're questioning it, probably make a repo
- But you should definitely do it if you ever plan on sharing code or results with anybody
- if you're writing a paper or sharing a model, **absolutely** use Git

## Too brief Git best practices
- commit often and well
- make sure you only add files that you mean to add, not all that garbage
- output files should not be included
