## Hello and welcome!
This is a collection of markdown notes to help teach how best to perform multidisciplinary design optimization. It is absolutely a work in progress. I wanted to share the progress here as we continue to develop this course.

Check out [[0 to optimization in 10 steps]] if you're looking for a quick example set of lessons contained in this course. Click around and see linked notes to merge ideas together.

Any and all feedback is welcome!

## Main points
- Course designed for MDO practitioners
- Assumes you have college-level engineering, differential equations, and numerical methods understanding
- Assumes you have some Python and OpenMDAO experience
- If you want to learn Python or OM, use these resources
- If you want to learn the theory, read the MDO Book or other papers or resources
- The ideas presented here come from decades of person-years experience from NASA Glenn Research Center, the MDO Lab at the University of Michigan, and other contributors.

## Aims of the course
- Codify a lot of the learned knowledge that exists between theory and implementation
- This knowledge is required to perform MDAO well
- Also see [[What this course is and isn't]] for more info

## Foundation for the course
- There are three main interconnected concepts required to perform good MDAO, as presented here: https://openmdao.org/the-3-keys-to-success-in-mdao/
- Those are model construction, model differentiation, and nonlinear optimization
- These concepts cannot be examined linearly as they are tightly connected in many ways
- We must jump between the three broad categories often and purposefully to better connect learning from these modules
- With that in mind, we've developed a small graphic to help reinforce when we are examining a concept from those broad categories. (this could be a three-part Venn diagram with the circle, first illustrated in manim)

## This course's format
- This course is meant to be processed asynchronously without input from anyone else both as an initial teaching tool and as a reference during future MDO
- Specifically, this is to help onboard NASA engineers joining aeronautics research projects, but is broadly helpful. See [[Who is this course useful for]]
- The course is a collection of mini-lecture YouTube videos
- These videos are compiled into distinct playlists
- Some of these playlists are for each of the broad categories, but there are also playlists for specific purposes or use cases
- A "choose your own adventure" approach is also presented to help highlight possible paths through this course material
