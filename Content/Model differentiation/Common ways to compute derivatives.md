## Main message
There are many ways to compute partial derivatives: finite-differencing, complex-step, analytically by hand, or through algorithmic differentiation. The best method depends on your problem formulation, but the best implementation usually involves an intelligent mix of these methods.

## Finite differencing

## Complex step

## Analytic by hand

## Algorithmic differentiation
