Discussing what to compute with respect to what
What the heck do we even do

## Main message
Computing derivatives of implicit functions can seem quite confusing at first, but it is not markedly harder than computing derivatives of explicit functions. Instead of getting d_outputs/d_inputs, you simply need to get d_residuals/d_inputs (and some other details lol).

## What do we need derivatives of?
- look at [[Implicit vs explicit]] to better understand the differences between implicit and explicit components
- there are some subtleties with solver_nonlinear and apply_nonlinear etc
- then explain just the extreme basics and where to learn more
- link to the UDE derivatives to make the math available
