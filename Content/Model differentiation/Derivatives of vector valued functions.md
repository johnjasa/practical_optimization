Diagnoal, non-diagonal, sparse

When you're computing a Jacobian, what are the rows and the columns?
Determine a nice way or pneumonic or know
A picture
dF/dX means what?

## Main message
Derivatives of a scalar with respect to a scalar might be relatively straightforward. Vector valued functions do not have to be impossibly difficult. You can use intelligent matrix and array operations to facilitate the process.
