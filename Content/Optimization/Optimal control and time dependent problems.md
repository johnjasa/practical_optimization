Static vs dynamic too


Optimal control and time-dependent problems. Holy shit. This is complex. Well, we first introduced it then I'll have more info about it. So optimal control. The whole idea is that you have a system and you're trying to control it. You're trying to say okay I need to throttle the engine, I need to turn the flaps on my aircraft.

I need to turn the blades of my wind turbine. These are all controls problems. The young of the wind turbines optimal control is finding the time dependent history of so that my PhD was actually on path dependent control. So good thing about like the thermal systems in an aircraft, it depends on the path.

You take the optimal control, you take influences the thermals and that matters, baby. Now automatically control, you do many different ways you can do. Dumb explicit integration. You can do pseudo, spectral integration, you static and dynamic analysis. All together, you can do the full thing together and optimize problem.

Now, there's something called control code designer, CCD goes by many terms.

But it's optimal control coupled with static design and something that we're doing at NASA Navier is something that Ed Real is doing. It's something that people at UIUC and CSU are doing. Now all of a sudden time depends, we can make extremely complex, because we have an additional dimension that we care about.

We care about the time dimension. I think about this, your analysis doesn't simply become more expensive. You have to possession becomes more expensive because now we have more design rules variables. We have something in the control, it's for time.

You're under setting your flaps and forget you have the option of such your flaps all over the place and your design space. So there's added dimensionality not just in the analysis but also in the optimization, these are extremely complex problems. After there are very flat design space. You can do this on naive, what you don't have to expose the states to the optimizer but you can.

Why is does not expose the open fast. States to the optimizer timeos, does expose the states. It needs the space to do pseudo-spectral methods.

I obviously need to talk to Rob about this. I need to talk to Elliot as well, and I need to talk to Dan Z. To see what he thinks about how I should train this. Now, if I'm suggesting how to do, optimal, design problems, optimal control problems. There's all sorts of details here.

There's all sorts of details.

I'll briefly introduce Dynamos, but I really don't want to believe this. But labor, this. I mean, you can always use diamonds. I mean, look at wise, we thought we're gonna use diamonds, but you can't, because we can't expose the states. We're both as stuck in fucking poetry. All right, after the control time dependent prompts very complex.
