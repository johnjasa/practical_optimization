## Main message
Gradient-based multidisciplinary optimization is the bee's knees. The cat's pajamas. The ultimate goal of this short course is for you to be able to formulate and solve complicated optimization problems using gradient-based methods in an efficient manner.

## What is gradient-based MDO?
- it's understandably hard in the grand scheme
- I don't know if you should watch this lecture first or last or somewhere in between and revisit it

## Gradient-based MDO allows you to solve tough problems
- you can solve problems that sequential optimization can't
- show some fantastic things from NASA
- show some fantastic things from MDO lab
- show some things from FLOW Lab
- show other labs and research groups

## Why is gradient-based MDO hard?
- you gotta track derivatives throughout the process
- when you couple disciplines and solvers it becomes challenging
- people get PhDs in coupled adjoints for disciplines

## OpenMDAO helps you do gradient-based MDO
- OM is the only purpose-built tool that helps you do this for engineering models
- others focus on just MDO or gradient-based optimization
- it handles a lot behind the scenes, including data and derivative passing
- it's based on the UDE and MAUD
- but OpenMDAO makes hard things easy and impossible things hard
- you end up in an arms race with what you're doing, hence the need for this course
- gradient-based MDO is our only hope for solving computationally expensive high-dimensional problems

you need both the nonlinear and linear systems; it's like Thelma and Louise, the Jay and Bey, the Mario and Luigi
