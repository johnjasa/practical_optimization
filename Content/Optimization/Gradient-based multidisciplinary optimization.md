## Main message
Gradient-based multidisciplinary optimization is the bee's knees. The cat's pajamas. The ultimate goal of this short course is for you to be able to formulate and solve optimization problems using gradient-based methods in an efficient manner.

## Context for gradient-based MDO
- it's understandably hard in the grand scheme
- but OpenMDAO makes hard things easy and impossible things hard
- you end up in an arms race with what you're doing, hence the need for this course
- gradient-based MDO is our only hope for solving computationally expensive high-dimensional problems
