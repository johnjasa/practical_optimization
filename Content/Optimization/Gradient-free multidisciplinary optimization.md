## Main message
Multidisciplinary optimization is much like single-disciplinary; you just need to construct and solve a reasonable model.

## Potential pitfalls
- optimization, especially gradient-free, may propel your model into uncharted territory in the design space
- you might get convergence issues, unrealistic results, all sorts of things you wouldn't dream of
- in the case of the model not converging, you might need to update how you handle extreme values, introduce analysis errors, or have tighter bounds on variables
